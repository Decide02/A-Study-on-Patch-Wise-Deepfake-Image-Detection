Abstract : In this paper, to detect deepfake images, images are divided into patches, determined whether they are forged for each patch, and the discrimination results for each patch are presented, and the detection preformance of images generated with StyleGAN2 is verified through experiments. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the detection accuracy varies depending on the patch size, but overall, the patch-based method can greatly improve detection accuracy and further improve detection accuracy by adding a process of selecting highly reliable patches.
